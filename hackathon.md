# TF-Agents

We are going to dive into the new Tensorflow TF-Agents library. This will make
the implementation of new RL algorithms easier. There are lots of preprogrammed
components and quite some environements (or wrappers around these
environments). To start I would like to try to recreate the DQN-cartpole
example using VScode's liveshare. Then I'll push the code to a repo and
separately we can try to implement different agents or preprogrammed
environments. Finally, we could try to add Flappy Fish as a TF-Agents
environment.

## Agenda

1. Try the DQN example with a cartpole environment (together - liveshare)
2. Change agent type (in groups)
3. Change environment (in groups)
4. Try on flappy fish or other environement?
